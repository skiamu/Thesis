\chapter{Model Description}
In this chapter, first the basic financial quantities are introduced and the asset allocation problem is stated, then the same problem will be embedded in a dynamical control system framework which will allows us to develop the stochastic reachability approach to portfolio construction. We closely follow \cite{Pola12},\cite{Pola06} and \cite{Pola}.
\section{Portfolio construction}
In the financial industry, a group of securities that exhibits similar characteristics in the market place and is subject to the same regulation is called \textbf{asset class}. Typical asset classes include stocks, bonds, real estate, cash and commodities. The discipline consisting in allocating investor's wealth among different asset classes is called \textbf{asset allocation}. We will now introduce the financial quantities and a formal mathematical setting suitable for describing the asset allocation problem. Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ be the underlying  probability space and consider a discrete set of time indexed by $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Moreover, let us consider a universe of $m \in \mathbb{N}$ asset classes. Asset classes' performance at period $k$ is described by a $m$-dimensional random vector $\bm{w}_k = [w_k(1),\ldots,w_k(m)]^T$ where $$ w_k(i) = \frac{z_k(i)-z_{k-1}(i)}{z_{k-1}(i)}, \quad i = 1,\ldots,m$$
is the rate of return of the $i$-th asset class and $\{z_k(i)\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ the $i$-th asset class price process. In general, the correlation of $\bm{w}_k$ can be of two kinds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{synchronous} correlation, that is the correlation among different asset class at the same time period
	\item \textit{time-lagged} correlation, that is the correlation among different asset class at different time period.
\end{itemize}
As the time-lagged correlation is usually negligible for short time period, $\bm{w}_k$ is a synchronous-correlated random vector. Standard notation is used for Expected Returns and Covariance Matrix $$\mu_k(i) = \mathbb{E}[w_k(i)], \quad i = 1,\ldots,m \quad k \in \mathbb{N}$$
 $$\Sigma_k(i,j) = \mathbb{E}\Big[\big(w_k(i)-\mu_k(i)\big)\big(w_k(j)-\mu_k(j)\big)\Big], \quad i,j = 1,\ldots,m \quad k \in \mathbb{N}$$
 An asset allocation at period $k \in \mathbb{N}$ is a vector $\bm{u}_k \in \mathbb{R}^m$ whose $i$-th element indicates the percentage of wealth to be invested in asset class $i$. This vector is the leverage the asset manager has at his disposal for driving the portfolio value towards his goals. Finally, portfolio performance over the period $[k-1,k]$ is measured by the portfolio return $$r_{k+1}=\frac{x_{k+1}-x_{k}}{x_k}$$ where $\{x_k\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is the portfolio value process. The portfolio return can also be expressed as a weighted average of each asset class return  as $$ r_{k+1} = \bm{u}_k^T \bm{w}_{k+1}$$
 By combining the two previous relations we get the following recursive equation 
 \begin{equation}
 \boxed{x_{k+1} = x_k (1 + \bm{u}_k^T \bm{w}_{k+1})}
 \end{equation}
 which describes the time evolution of portfolio value. In plain words, the \textbf{asset allocation problem} consists in choosing the vector $\bm{u}_k$ at each time period $k \in \mathbb{N}$ so as to achieve investor's goal (i.e. beating a benchmark, maximizing the return and so on). As a matter of fact, the asset allocation vector $\bm{u}_k$ is bound to stay within a feasible set $U_k$, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$. In this work, the feasible set $U_k$ is obtained by imposing the following constraints
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item \textit{budget} constraint: $\sum_{i=1}^{m}u_k(i)=1$, all the wealth is invested in the portfolio
 	\item \textit{long-only} constraint: $u_k(i) \geq 0,\quad i = 1,\ldots,m$, no short-selling are allowed
 	\item \textit{risk} constraint: the metric value-at-risk ($V@R$) is used to limit portfolio risk. 
 \end{itemize}

\section{Stochastic Reachability Approach}
In the previous section the financial setting has been laid, now it will be embedded in a more general framework by employing the theory of dynamical systems. We will see that this formalism will allow us to formulate the asset allocation problem as a \textbf{stochastic reachability} problem which will be solved by using \textbf{dynamic programming} (DP) techniques. Let us introduce the following stochastic discrete-time dynamic control system $$x_{k+1} = f(x_k,\bm{u}_k,\bm{w}_{k+1}) = x_k (1 + \bm{u}_k^T \bm{w}_{k+1})$$ where, for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $x_k \in \mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}$ is the system state (portfolio value), $\mathcal{X}$ the system space
	\item $\bm{u}_k \in U \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the control input (asset allocation vector), $U$ the control input space
	\item $\bm{w}_{k}$ is a $m$-dimensional random vector (asset class returns) with density function $p_{\bm{w}_k}$
\end{itemize}

Let $\mathcal{U} = \big\{ \mu : \mathcal{X} \times \mathbb{N} \rightarrow U \big\}$ be the class of controls. In other words, $\mu \in \mathcal{U}$ is a map such that for any $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and any $k \in \mathbb{N}$, associates an asset allocation vector $\bm{u}_k \in U$.
Given $N \in \mathbb{N}$ we define the set of control sequences as $\mathcal{U}_N = \big\{\pi = \{\mu_k\}_{k=0,\ldots,N}  : \mu_k \in \mathcal{U} \big\}$ and call any $\pi \in \mathcal{U}_N$ a \textbf{control policy}. Denote by $\pi^k$ a control policy starting at period $k$, that is $\pi^k=\{\mu_k,\ldots,\mu_N\}$. We are now ready to formulate the asset allocation problem in stochastic reachability terms
\begin{problem}[Optimal Dynamic Asset Allocation]\label{prb:ODAA}
Given a finite time horizon $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and a sequence of target sets $\{X_1,\ldots,X_N \} $ such that each target set is a subset of the state space $\mathcal{X}$, find the optimal control policy $\pi^{\star} \in \mathcal{U}_{N-1}$ that maximizes the following objective function 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:obj_fun_ODAA}
\mathbb{P}\big(\{\omega \in \Omega : x_0 \in X_0,\ldots,x_N \in X_N \} \big)
\end{equation}
\end{problem}
The target sets $\{X_1,\ldots,X_N \}$ represent the investor's goal and we can think of them as the "good" states where we want the portfolio value to belongs to. For instance, a target set could be $X_k = [\underline{x}_k,\infty)$. Problem (\ref{prb:ODAA}) is solved by resorting to dynamic programming. To this end, let $p_{f(x,\bm{u},\bm{w}_{k+1})}$ be the probability density function of random variable $f(x_k,\bm{u}_k,\bm{w}_{k+1}) = x_k (1 + \bm{u}_k^T \bm{w}_{k+1})$.
\begin{definition}[value function]
	Given a sequence of target sets $\{X_k\}_{k\geq0}$, the \textbf{value function} is the following real map
	\begin{align*}
	V \colon \mathbb{N}\times \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{U} & \rightarrow [0,1]\\
	(k,x,\pi^k) & \mapsto V(k,x,\pi^k)
	\end{align*}
	such that 
	\[V(k,x,\pi^k)=
	\begin{cases}
	    \mathbbm{1}_{X_N}(x) & \quad \text{if} \quad k = N \\
	    \int_{X_{k+1}}V(k+1,z,\pi^{k+1})p_{f(x,\bm{u},\bm{w}_{k+1})}(z)\mathrm{d}z & \quad \text{if} \quad k = N-1,\ldots,0
	\end{cases}
	\]
	\end{definition}
It is now possible to link the objective function (\ref{eq:obj_fun_ODAA}) to the value function (see \cite{Pola}) in the following way \[\mathbb{P}\big(\{\omega \in \Omega : x_0 \in X_0,\ldots,x_N \in X_N \} \big) = V(0,x_0,\pi). \]
This result is extremely important since it allows us to rewrite the ODAA problem in terms of the value function as follows
\begin{problem}[Optimal Dynamic Asset Allocation 2]\label{prb:ODAA2}
  Given a finite time horizon $N \in \mathbb{N}$ and a sequence of target sets $\{X_1,\ldots,X_N \}$, find $$\pi^{\star} = \argmax_{\pi \in \mathcal{U}_{N-1}}V(0,x_0,\pi). $$	
\end{problem}
So far, we have reached an intermediate point where the ODAA problem has been restated in terms of a value function $V$. The tool of dynamic programming gives us the final step, which is synthesized in the following theorem
\begin{theorem}[ODAA algorithm]\label{thm:rec_algo}
	the optimal value of the ODAA problem (\ref{prb:ODAA2}) is \[p^{\star} = J_0(x_0),\] where for any $x \in \mathcal{X},$ $J_0(x)$ is the final step of the following algorithm
	\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align} \label{eq:rec_algo}
	J_N(x) & = \mathbbm{1}_{X_N}(x) \nonumber \\
	J_k(x) & = \sup_{\bm{u}_k \in U_k}\int_{X_{k+1}}J_{k+1}(z)p_{f(x,\bm{u}_k,\bm{w}_{k+1})}(z)\mathrm{dz} \\
	& k = N-1,\ldots,1,0 \nonumber
	\end{empheq}
\end{theorem}
The previous result provides us with a backward procedure (it starts at time $N$ and ends at time $0$) whose outputs are the optimal control policy $\pi^{\star}=\{\mu_0^{\star},\ldots,\mu_{N-1}^{\star}\}$ and the optimal probability $p^{\star}$ of reaching the target sets. It is worth pointing out some interesting features of algorithm in (\ref{eq:rec_algo}):
\begin{itemize}
	\item $J_k(x)$ is a function of portfolio realization $x \in \mathcal{X}$ at time $k$. This dependence is hidden behind the probability density function $p_{f(x,\bm{u}_k,\bm{w}_{k+1})}$
	\item the constrained optimization must be numerically carried out in a space ($U_k$) of dimension $m \in \mathbb{N}$. At each iteration $k = N-1,\ldots,1,0$, the optimization has to be repeated for each $x$ belonging to a suitable discretized grid
	\item the algorithm presented in theorem (\ref{thm:rec_algo}) does not depend on the particular distribution of random variable $f(x,\bm{u}_k,\bm{w}_{k+1})$. This fact gives us enough freedom to look outside the usual Guassian world
	\item given a period $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and a portfolio value realization $x \in \mathcal{X}$, $\mu_k^{\star}(x) \in U_k$ tells us which is the optimal allocation mix of our portfolio.
\end{itemize}

We now ask ourselves which probability distributions are suitable for vector $\bm{w}_{k+1}$; the answer to this question is the main objective of the next chapter.
